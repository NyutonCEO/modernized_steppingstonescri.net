# Stakeholder Decision Log

## Sources Reviewed
- /stakeholder-surveys/ (existing survey results page)
- /notices/ (operational information for stakeholders, personnel, and persons served)

## Decisions
- **Preserve stakeholder resources section** - Source: Stakeholder Surveys + Notices pages. Decision: accepted. Rationale: keep original stakeholder-facing content and links available in Resources and Footer for transparency.
- **Phone-first CTA emphasis** - Source: launch requirements (advisory) and site goals. Decision: accepted. Rationale: primary conversion is phone call; added global CTA blocks without changing informational content.
- **Image localization** - Source: launch requirements (advisory). Decision: accepted. Rationale: remove external hotlinks and improve performance; placeholders used where originals are missing.

## Notes
- No additional stakeholder feedback files were found in the repo. If new feedback is added later, append here with decision and rationale.
