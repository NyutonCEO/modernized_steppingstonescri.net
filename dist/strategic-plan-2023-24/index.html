<p style="text-align: left;">We reviewed the information you have provided and developed a strategic plan FY 2023-2024. Our goal is to provide you with services and resources to help to improve your quality of life and make a difference in our community.</p>
<p>Many of you have expressed that after completing the program you feel lost that there is nothing in the community to support your recovery in 2023 SSCRI will implement three (3) step down programs. The goal of these programs is to support those we serve as they navigate recovery and transition through life’s challenges.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>PEARLS program- Target date March 2023</h3>
<p>The Pearls program is an extended case management program designed to help you navigate appointments and provide support as you transition through recovery.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Group Therapy: Women’s Group and Men’s Group. – Target date April 2023</h3>
<p>Presently fy2022 60% of our groups are comprised of women and 40% are male. We know that the issues that women face (93% are single parents) and those of male (80% unemployment difficult time obtaining assistance) are uniquely different. The fundamental goal of group therapy is to initiate a sense of belonging or relatability through understanding, which is achieved by sharing common experiences. For this reason, we are developing a Men’s and Women’s therapy groups. Group therapy is found to be most effective when utilized to address a specific concern common to all members of the group.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Supportive Employment – Target Jan 2024</h3>
<p>Supported Employment Services” refers to helping people with Mental Health, Substance and development disabilities obtain and maintain competitive employment. Supported employment teaches individuals more about responsibility, self-sufficiency, and independence. We know that many of those we serve have not been employed in some time, You will be working with a job coach who will provide guidance and support.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Performance Measurement and Management</h3>
<p><strong>Reason for Quality Measurement-Management Goal:</strong> To improve persons served satisfaction in SSCRI SAIOP/SACOT services.</p>
<p>· SSCRI provides comprehensive behavioral health services to include, clinical assessment, therapy, case management, SAIOP, and SACOT services.</p>
<p>· SSCRI conducts daily consumers’ satisfaction through the use of the Group Treatment Feedback Form, which provides daily assessment of consumers’ satisfaction in the following areas: rating of treatment sessions, consumers’ openness to share in treatment group, favorite part of treatment group, and assessing consumers’ feelings prior and after treatment group.</p>
<p>· Within a week prior to discharge from SSCRI treatment services, each consumer attends discharge orientation. In orientation each consumer is encouraged to complete SSCRI Discharge Measurement Tool survey, which evaluates SSCRI in the 12-core functions of substance abuse treatment including, screening, intake, orientation, assessment, treatment planning, counseling, case management, crisis intervention, consumer education, referrals, reports and record keeping, and consultation with other professionals.</p>
<p>· SSCRI randomly selects a series of Group Treatment Feedback Forms and SSCRI Discharge Measurement Tool surveys to assess SSCRI consumer satisfaction ratings in the above listed categories.</p>
<p>· SSCRI analyzes the randomly selected surveys in an Excel spreadsheet to receive accurate percentage in the above listed categories.</p>
<p>· Once the results are completed, results are reviewed by the Leadership/Management Committee and implementations of organizational changes are discussed (if applicable).</p>
